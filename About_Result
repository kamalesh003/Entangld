TEST 1: Single Qubit Operations

    Initialization: Correctly starts in |0⟩ state

    Superposition: Hadamard gate creates perfect (0.707, 0.707) superposition

    Measurement Statistics: Shows near-perfect 50/50 distribution (49.62% |0⟩ vs 50.38% |1⟩) across 10,000 trials

    Gate Operations:

        X gate properly flips |0⟩ to |1⟩

        Z gate adds phase to |1⟩ state

        H gate creates superposition from |1⟩ state

TEST 2: Bell State Entanglement (2-Qubit)

    Entanglement Formation: Successfully creates linked qubits

    Perfect Correlation: 100% matching measurements across 1,000 trials

    Measurement Propagation: When one qubit measures |0⟩, the other instantly collapses to |0⟩ (confirmed in GHZ test)

TEST 3: GHZ State (3-Qubit)

    Multi-Qubit Entanglement: All 3 qubits maintain identical states

    Perfect Correlation: 100% identical measurements across all qubits in 1,000 trials

    Measurement Propagation: Measuring one qubit causes all others to collapse to the same state

TEST 4: Decoherence

    Timed Collapse:

        Maintains superposition for 300ms (within 500ms timeout)

        Automatically collapses after full 500ms

    Random Collapse: Results show probabilistic collapse (test showed |1⟩ but would vary)

TEST 5: Advanced Entanglement (4-Qubit)

    Maximum Entanglement: Demonstrates system limit of 4-way entanglement

    Full Correlation: All 4 qubits collapse to same measurement value

    System Limits: Successfully tests the maximum 4-link architecture
